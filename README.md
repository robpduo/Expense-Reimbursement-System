# Expense-Reimbursement-System 

## Project Description
The Expense Reimbursement System manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred. 

## Features

Employees are
given the option to be registered into the system with a chosen unique username and a(n) auto generated account Id that will be associated with the account. After registering an account, an employee will be able to login to the account with the corresponding username and password, and submit a reimbursement request for later approval by a managerial account. The employee may display previous request that have been resolved and filter the result by type of reimbursement. Pending requests may also be viewed and its results can also be filtered by type. 

Managers are given the same functionality with the addition to view all pending and resolved requests in the system and filter the results by reimbursement type, account id, and status of the request. Managers may choose to deny or approve pending requests.
